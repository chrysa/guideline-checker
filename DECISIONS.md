## D-0002 — Adopt PyYAML for the structured rule referential

**Date**: 2026-06-09
**Status**: accepted

The multi-dimension rule referential (`guidelines/<dimension>/*.yml`) is authored in
YAML (per the chrysa spec). Parsing it adds **`PyYAML`** as the core CLI's first and only
runtime dependency, ending the previous "zero runtime dependencies" property (markdown
sources still parse with the stdlib `re`-based loader). `PyYAML` is ubiquitous, pure-data,
and stub-typed (`types-PyYAML`), so the cost is minimal.

*Rejected alternative*: TOML + stdlib `tomllib` (zero-dep) — contradicts the spec's YAML
format and reads poorly for nested rule lists.

The referential is **100 % Notion-agnostic**: rule files carry no `source_ref` and no links
back to Notion. Origin traceability lives in git history only. Notion may serve as an
upstream editor, but repatriation to the repo is a one-off copy — once in the repo, rules
are self-sufficient.
